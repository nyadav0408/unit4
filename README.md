# Unit-4-Project-OOP-Game-Show

- This project was created as a part of an assignment for Advanced Topics: Web App Development by Mr. Ostrom 

- This project uses two classes and an app.js file to run the functions within the classes 

- The majority of the functionality is within the Game class, and it calls functions within the Phrase class through the active Phrase in the class

- The html and css were mostly given as a part of the assignment, but I made a few changes within both to better fit my project
